POX-PLUS is a new SDN controller based on the popular POX controller [1]. POX-PLUS
includes a new routing module called DR-APSP that computes
and maintains paths between nodes in the SDN. DR-APSP
provides SDN routing based on dynamic shortest paths. Our
solution scales to frequent network topology changes and avoids
recomputing entire paths when changes occur.


DR-APSP code is written in Python and can be founf in POX-PLUS/pox/pox/forwarding/DR-APSP.py

Code for Graph implementation an dthe Dynamic APSP can be found in POX-PLUS/pox/pox/Graph.py

The best way to run POX-PLUS is by:
	sudo python pox.py forwarding.apsp openflow.discovery --eat-early-packets  host_tracker
